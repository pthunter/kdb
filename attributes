Applying Attributes

All attributes can be applied to lists that meets that attribute's requirements. Since columns of a table are themselves lists, attributes can be applied to them. The three formats for applying attributes are:

l:`s#2 4 7 9        
    - Specify during list creation

@[`.; `listl; `s#] 
    - Functional apply, i.e. to the variable list l in the default namespace `. apply the sorted `s# attribute.

update `s#time from `t 
    - update a table to apply the attribute.
